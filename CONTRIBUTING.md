# Contributing to native-integrations

This repository owns reusable native controls/integrations under
`containers/integrations/` and related public examples. Keep platform code and
shared control APIs usable independently of Studio application implementation.

## Development conventions

Use the installed Buoy language reference and verify changed `.bui` files with
the compiler. Prefer native Buoy/BuoyScript for new automation. Preserve public
command names, environment-variable contracts and explicit platform limitations.

## Build context

Start with the [integration sources](containers/integrations/), then the
README for the component you change. Build through the assembled workspace when
its native dependencies, package archives or build helpers are required.

```sh
# From the BuoyBay workspace root, with sibling checkouts available:
./dist/workspace-manager/buoybay assemble
```

Run the chosen component's documented compiler/build entrypoint from
`local/integration/`, and exercise the real control on its supported desktop host.
GTK, Cocoa and Windows runtime behavior each require that host/backend; successful
cross-target syntax checks do not establish input, focus or lifecycle behavior.

## Verification and pull requests

For each edited Buoy entrypoint, in its documented staged dependency context:

```sh
buoy path/to/entrypoint.bui --check --diagnostic-format json
```

Require exit status zero and an empty `errors` array. Read warnings. Check each
affected conditional platform branch with `--target`; compiler checks do not prove
native runtime behavior on another OS. Build/link and exercise the changed API or
workflow on its supported host as well.

Include your compiler/tool versions, host/target, exact build and
reproduction commands, expected behavior and observed output in the pull request.
Do not commit generated builds, caches, credentials or machine
configuration. Keep the patch focused and note any unverified platforms or runtime
prerequisites. Inventory checks alone are not build or test acceptance.
